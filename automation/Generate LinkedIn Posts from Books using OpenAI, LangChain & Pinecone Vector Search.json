The work of preparing International Standards is normally\ncarried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which\na technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee.\nInternational organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in\nthe work. In the field of conformity assessment, ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission\n(IEC) develop joint ISO/IEC documents under the management of the ISO Committee on Conformity\nassessment (ISO/CASCO).\nThe procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are\ndescribed in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the\ndifferent types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the\neditorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see w w w.iso.org/directives\n).\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of\npatent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of\nany patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or\non the ISO list of patent declarations received (see w w w.iso.org/patents\n).\nAny trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of users and does not\nconstitute an endorsement.\nFor an explanation on the voluntary nature of standards, the meaning of ISO specific terms and\nexpressions related to conformity assessment, as well as information about ISO's adherence to the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) principles in the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) see the following\nURL: w ww.iso.org/iso/foreword.html\n.\nThis document was prepared by the ISO Committee on Conformity Assessment (CASCO) and circulated\nfor voting to the national bodies of both ISO and IEC, and was approved by both organizations.\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO/IEC 17025:2005), which has been\ntechnically revised.\nThe main changes compared to the previous edition are as follows:\n‚Äî the risk-based thinking applied in this edition has enabled some reduction in prescriptive\nrequirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements;\n‚Äî there is greater flexibility than in the previous edition in the requirements for processes, procedures,\ndocumented information and organizational responsibilities;\n‚Äî a definition of ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù has been added (see 3.6\n).\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n6\nIntroduction\nThis document has been developed with the objective of promoting confidence in the operation of\nlaboratories. This document contains requirements for laboratories to enable them to demonstrate they\noperate competently, and are able to generate valid results. Laboratories that conform to this document\nwill also operate generally in accordance with the principles of ISO 9001.\nThis document requires the laboratory to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities.\nAddressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the\nmanagement system, achieving improved results and preventing negative effects. The laboratory is\nresponsible for deciding which risks and opportunities need to be addressed.\nThe use of this document will facilitate cooperation between laboratories and other bodies, and assist\nin the exchange of information and experience, and in the harmonization of standards and procedures.\nThe acceptance of results between countries is facilitated if laboratories conform to this document.\nIn this document, the following verbal forms are used:\n‚Äî ‚Äúshall‚Äù indicates a requirement;\n‚Äî ‚Äúshould‚Äù indicates a recommendation;\n‚Äî ‚Äúmay‚Äù indicates a permission;\n‚Äî ‚Äúcan‚Äù indicates a possibility or a capability.\nFurther details can be found in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.\nFor the purposes of research, users are encouraged to share their views on this document and their\npriorities for changes to future editions.

The feedback\nshall be analysed and used to improve the management system, laboratory activities and customer\nservice.\nNOTE Examples of the types of feedback include customer satisfaction surveys, communication records and\nreview of reports with customers.\n8.7 Corrective actions (Option A)\n8.7.1 When a nonconformity occurs, the laboratory shall:\na) react to the nonconformity and, as applicable:\n‚Äî take action to control and correct it;\n‚Äî address the consequences;\nb) evaluate the need for action to eliminate the cause(s) of the nonconformity, in order that it does not\nrecur or occur elsewhere, by:\n‚Äî reviewing and analysing the nonconformity;\n‚Äî determining the causes of the nonconformity;\n‚Äî determining if similar nonconformities exist, or could potentially occur;\nc) implement any action needed;\nd) review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken;\ne) update risks and opportunities determined during planning, if necessary;\nf) make changes to the management system, if necessary.\n8.7.2 Corrective actions shall be appropriate to the effects of the nonconformities encountered.\n8.7.3 The laboratory shall retain records as evidence of:\na) the nature of the nonconformities, cause(s) and any subsequent actions taken;\nb) the results of any corrective action.\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n23\n8.8 Internal audits (Option A)\n8.8.1 The laboratory shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to provide information on\nwhether the management system:\na) conforms to:\n‚Äî the laboratory‚Äôs own requirements for its management system, including the laboratory\nactivities;\n‚Äî the requirements of this document;\nb) is effectively implemented and maintained.\n8.8.2 The laboratory shall:\na) plan, establish, implement and maintain an audit programme including the frequency, methods,\nresponsibilities, planning requirements and reporting, which shall take into consideration the\nimportance of the laboratory activities concerned, changes affecting the laboratory, and the results\nof previous audits;\nb) define the audit criteria and scope for each audit;\nc) ensure that the results of the audits are reported to relevant management;\nd) implement appropriate correction and corrective actions without undue delay;\ne) retain records as evidence of the implementation of the audit programme and the audit results.\nNOTE ISO 19011 provides guidance for internal audits.\n8.9 Management reviews (Option A)\n8.9.1 The laboratory management shall review its management system at planned intervals, in order to\nensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness, including the stated policies and objectives\nrelated to the fulfilment of this document.\n8.9.2 The inputs to management review shall be recorded and shall include information related to the\nfollowing:\na) changes in internal and external issues that are relevant to the laboratory;\nb) fulfilment of objectives;\nc) suitability of policies and procedures;\nd) status of actions from previous management reviews;\ne) outcome of recent internal audits;\nf) corrective actions;\ng) assessments by external bodies;\nh) changes in the volume and type of the work or in the range of laboratory activities;\ni) customer and personnel feedback;\nj) complaints;\nk) effectiveness of any implemented improvements;\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n24\nl) adequacy of resources;\nm) results of risk identification;\nn) outcomes of the assurance of the validity of results; and\no) other relevant factors, such as monitoring activities and training.\n8.9.3 The outputs from the management review shall record all decisions and actions related to at least:\na) the effectiveness of the management system and its processes;\nb) improvement of the laboratory activities related to the fulfilment of the requirements of this\ndocument;\nc) provision of required resources;\nd) any need for change.\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n25\nAnnex A\n(informative)\nMetrological traceability\nA.1 General\nThis annex provides additional information on metrological traceability, which is an important concept\nto ensure comparability of measurement results both nationally and internationally.\nA.2 Establishing metrological traceability\nA.2.1 Metrological traceability is established by considering, and then ensuring, the following:\na) the specification of the measurand (quantity to be measured);\nb) a documented unbroken chain of calibrations going back to stated and appropriate references\n(appropriate references include national or international standards, and intrinsic standards);\nc) that measurement uncertainty for each step in the traceability chain is evaluated according to\nagreed methods;\nd) that each step of the chain is performed in accordance with appropriate methods, with the\nmeasurement results and with associated, recorded measurement uncertainties;\ne) that the laboratories performing one or more steps in the chain supply evidence for their technical\ncompetence.\nA.2.2 The systematic measurement error (sometimes called ‚Äúbias‚Äù) of the calibrated equipment is\ntaken into account to disseminate metrological traceability to measurement results in the laboratory.\nThere are several mechanisms available to take into account the systematic measurement errors in the\ndissemination of measurement metrological traceability.\nA.2.3 Measurement standards that have reported information from a competent laboratory that\nincludes only a statement of conformity to a specification (omitting the measurement results and\nassociated uncertainties) are sometimes used to disseminate metrological traceability. This approach, in\nwhich the specification limits are imported as the source of uncertainty, is dependent upon:\n‚Äî the use of an appropriate decision rule to establish conformity;\n‚Äî the specification limits subsequently being treated in a technically appropriate way in the\nuncertainty budget.\nThe technical basis for this approach is that the declared conformance to a specification defines a range\nof measurement values, within which the true value is expected to lie, at a specified level of confidence,\nwhich considers both any bias from the true value, as well as the measurement uncertainty.\nEXAMPLE The use of OIML R 111 class weights to calibrate a balance.\nA.3 Demonstrating metrological traceability\nA.3.1 Laboratories are responsible for establishing metrological traceability in accordance with this\ndocument. Calibration results from laboratories conforming to this document provide metrological\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n26\ntraceability. Certified values of certified reference materials from reference material producers\nconforming to ISO 17034 provide metrological traceability. There are various ways to demonstrate\nconformity with this document: third party recognition (such as an accreditation body), external\nassessment by customers or self-assessment. Internationally accepted paths include, but are not limited\nto, the following.\na) Calibration and measurement capabilities provided by national metrology institutes and designated\ninstitutes that have been subject to suitable peer-review processes. Such peer-review is conducted\nunder the CIPM MRA (International Committee for Weights and Measures Mutual Recognition\nArrangement). Services covered by the CIPM MRA can be viewed in Appendix C of the BIPM KCDB\n(International Bureau of Weights and Measures Key Comparison Database) which details the range\nand measurement uncertainty for each listed service.\nb) Calibration and measurement capabilities that have been accredited by an accreditation body\nsubject to the ILAC (International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation) Arrangement or to\nRegional Arrangements recognized by ILAC have demonstrated metrological traceability. Scopes of\naccredited laboratories are publicly available from their respective accreditation bodies.\nA.3.2 The Joint BIPM, OIML (International Organization of Legal Metrology), ILAC and ISO Declaration\non Metrological Traceability provides specific guidance when there is a need to demonstrate international\nacceptability of the metrological traceability chain.\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n27\nAnnex B\n(informative)\nManagement system options\nB.1 Growth in the use of management systems generally has increased the need to ensure that\nlaboratories can operate a management system that is seen as conforming to ISO 9001, as well as to\nthis document. As a result, this document provides two options for the requirements related to the\nimplementation of a management system.\nB.2 Option A (see 8.1.2) lists the minimum requirements for implementation of a management system\nin a laboratory. Care has been taken to incorporate all those requirements of ISO 9001 that are relevant\nto the scope of laboratory activities that are covered by the management system. Laboratories that\ncomply with \nClauses 4 to 7 and implement Option A of Clause 8 will therefore also operate generally in\naccordance with the principles of ISO 9001.\nB.3 Option B (see 8.1.3) allows laboratories to establish and maintain a management system in\naccordance with the requirements of ISO 9001, in a manner that supports and demonstrates the\nconsistent fulfilment of Clauses 4 to 7. Laboratories that implement Option B of Clause 8 will therefore\nalso operate in accordance with ISO 9001. Conformity of the management system within which the\nlaboratory operates to the requirements of ISO 9001 does not, in itself, demonstrate the competence of\nthe laboratory to produce technically valid data and results. This is accomplished through compliance\nwith \nClauses 4 to 7.\nB.4 Both options are intended to achieve the same result in the performance of the management\nsystem and compliance with Clauses 4 to 7\n.\nNOTE Documents, data and records are components of documented information as used in ISO 9001 and\nother management system standards. Control of documents is covered in 8.3\n. The control of records is covered in\n8.4 and 7.5. The control of data related to the laboratory activities is covered in 7.11.\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n28\nB.5 Figure B.1 illustrates an example of a possible schematic representation of the operational\nprocesses of a laboratory, as described in Clause 7.\nFigure B.1 ‚Äî Possible schematic representation of the operational processes of a laboratory\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n29\nBibliography\n[1] ISO 5725-1, Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results ‚Äî Part 1:\nGeneral principles and definitions\n[2] ISO 5725-2, Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results ‚Äî Part 2: Basic\nmethod for the determination of repeatability and reproducibility of a standard measurement method\n[3] ISO 5725-3, Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results ‚Äî Part 3:\nIntermediate measures of the precision of a standard measurement method\n[4] ISO 5725-4, Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results ‚Äî Part 4: Basic\nmethods for the determination of the trueness of a standard measurement method\n[5] ISO 5725-6, Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results ‚Äî Part 6: Use\nin practice of accuracy values\n[6] ISO 9000, Quality management systems ‚Äî Fundamentals and vocabulary\n[7] ISO 9001, Quality management systems ‚Äî Requirements\n[8] ISO 10012, Measurement management systems ‚Äî Requirements for measurement processes and\nmeasuring equipment\n[9] ISO/IEC 12207, Systems and software engineering ‚Äî Software life cycle processes\n[10] ISO 15189, Medical laboratories ‚Äî Requirements for quality and competence\n[11] ISO 15194, In vitro diagnostic medical devices ‚Äî Measurement of quantities in samples of\nbiological origin ‚Äî Requirements for certified reference materials and the content of supporting\ndocumentation\n[12] ISO/IEC 17011, Conformity assessment ‚Äî Requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting\nconformity assessment bodies\n[13] ISO/IEC 17020, Conformity assessment ‚Äî Requirements for the operation of various types of bodies\nperforming inspection\n[14] ISO/IEC 17021-1, Conformity assessment ‚Äî Requirements for bodies providing audit and\ncertification of management systems ‚Äî Part 1: Requirements\n[15] ISO 17034, General requirements for the competence of reference material producers\n[16] ISO/IEC 17043, Conformity assessment ‚Äî General requirements for proficiency testing\n[17] ISO/IEC 17065, Conformity assessment ‚Äî Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes\nand services\n[18] ISO 17511, In vitro diagnostic medical devices ‚Äî Measurement of quantities in biological samples ‚Äî\nMetrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators and control materials\n[19] ISO 19011, Guidelines for auditing management systems\n[20] ISO 21748, Guidance for the use of repeatability, reproducibility and trueness estimates in\nmeasurement uncertainty evaluation\n[21] ISO 31000, Risk management ‚Äî Guidelines\n[22] ISO Guide 30, Reference materials ‚Äî Selected terms and definitions\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\n30\n[23] ISO Guide 31, Reference materials ‚Äî Contents of certificates, labels and\naccompanying documentation\n[24] ISO Guide 33, Reference materials ‚Äî Good practice in using reference materials\n[25] ISO Guide 35, Reference materials ‚Äî Guidance for characterization and assessment\nof homogeneity \nand stability\n[26] ISO Guide 80, Guidance for the in-house preparation of quality control materials\n(QCMs)\n[27] ISO/IEC Guide 98-3, Uncertainty of measurement ‚Äî Part 3: Guide to the\nexpression of uncertainty \nin measurement (GUM:1995)\n[28] ISO/IEC Guide 98-4, Uncertainty of measurement ‚Äî Part 4: Role of measurement\nuncertainty in conformity assessment\n[29] IEC Guide 115, Application of uncertainty of measurement to conformity\nassessment activities in the electrotechnical sector\n[30] Joint BIPM, OIML, ILAC and ISO declaration on metrological traceability, 2011 \n2)\n[31] International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) \n3)\n[32] International vocabulary of terms in legal metrology (VIML), OIML V1:2013\n[33] JCGM 106:2012, Evaluation of measurement data ‚Äî The role of measurement\nuncertainty in conformity assessment\n[34] The Selection and Use of Reference Materials, EEE/RM/062rev3, Eurachem \n4)\n[35] SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI), BIPM \n5)\n2) http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/BIPM-OIML-ILAC-ISO_joint_declaration_2011.pdf\n3) http://ilac.org/\n4) https://www.eurachem.org/images/stories/Guides/pdf/EEE-RM-062rev3.pdf\n5) http://www.bipm.org/en/publicatio\nL\n\n\n\nISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)\nICS 03.120.20\nPrice based on 30 pages\n¬© ISO/IEC 2017 ‚Äì All rights reserved",
