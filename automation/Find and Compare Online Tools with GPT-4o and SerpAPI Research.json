  "description": "![AIPowered Online Tool Finder Utilizing GPT4o.png](fileId:1753)\n\n# What It Does\nThis powerful workflow can take hours of difficult research attempting to identify the perfect online tool to aid you with your business and condenses it into a few short seconds. Simply typing the name of an online tool you would like to identify into a chat message will initiate the workflow to begin its search process to identify 5 companies that will provide you with the online tool you desire. The initial chat will prompt the Tool Finder AI agent utilizing the power of GPT-4o in combination with SerpAPI to conduct a search and find 5 top end companies that contain the online tool you desire. It will then send the name of each company to five separate Reviewer Tool Agents that will gather information on each company. Each Reviewer Tools Agent will again harness the power of GPT-4o and SerpAPI to give a detailed descriptions of the online tool available including its price, limitations, summary of reviews, pros and cons, as well as an overall conclusion of the online tool.\n\n# Who This Is For\nThis is the perfect workflow for anyone who is interested in obtaining an online tool to help automate business or everyday tasks. Rather than spending an excess amount of time searching through websites and review pages to determine the best product available this workflow completes the process for you. It provides five options in a condensed form that easily lets you compare and evaluate the options in a single place. Whether you are searching for an automatic email responder or the best available online spreadsheet, this workflow is exactly what you need to help bring your business to the next level.\n\n# How It Works\nBegin by opening the chat trigger node and typing the name of an online tool you would like to use to improve your day to day tasks. Example: Automatic email responder, automatic instagram poster, or online spreadsheet.\nThis will trigger the Tool Finder Tools Agent to begin to utilize GPT-4o to begin to create search queries based off the tool you wish to identify. It will then use these search queries with SerpAPI to identify 5 companies that provide the online tool you desire. After it has obtained the names of five companies it will then in a structured output, send each item to a separate Reviewer Tools Agent.\nOnce the Reviewer Tools Agent has received the name of the item it will then begin an in-depth review of that item. Each Reviewer Tools Agent will again use the power of GPT-4o connected with SerpAPI to obtain the most up to date information on each item from the internet. For each company and its tool you will be provided with:\n\n- Price: If it is a one time purchase, monthly subscription and if there is a free version.\n- Limits: It will provide any limitations on completing the desired tasks. If there is a limit on number of tasks that can be completed. If it only works with certain software.\n- Summary of reviews: It will provide an overall summary of the reviews, how many reviews, as well as the star rating of each item. It will go in depth on the summary of the reviews. It will provide 3-4 pros and 2-3 cons of each item. \n- Conclusion: It will provide an overall summary of the tool. \n\n\nAfter each of the Reviewer Tools Agent is complete with its review of the company and the online tool they provide, they will all send the information along to a Compiler Tools Agent. This tools agent uses GPT-4o-mini to arrange the data and present it in a concise, organized fashion. This allows for easy readability.\n# Set Up Steps\n\n\n1. You will need to obtain an Open AI API key from platform.openai.com/api-keys\n2. After you obtain this Open AI API key you will need to connect it to the Open AI Chat Model for all of the Tools agents (Item finder, Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, Reviewer 4, Reviewer 5, and Compiler).\n3. You will now need to fund your Open AI account. GPT 4o costs ~$0.03-$0.04 to run the workflow.\n4. Next you will need to create a SerpAPI account at https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up\n5. After you create an account you will need to obtain a SerpAPI key.\n6. You will then need to use this key to connect to the SerpAPI tool for each of the tools agents (Tool finder, Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, Reviewer 3, Reviewer 4, and Reviewer 5)\n7. Tip: SerpAPI will allow you to run 100 free searches each month. This workflow uses ~15-30 SerpAPI searches per run. If you would like to utilize the workflow more than that each month, create multiple SerpAPI accounts and have an API key for each account. When you utilize all 100 free searches for an account, switch to the API key for another account within the workflow.",

You will receive the name of a tool or a company as well as the task that is trying to be accomplished. ¬†These items will be {{ $json.output.ItemNames[4] }}. You will search for this item in order to find the price of usage, if there is a free version, is there a limit on how many tasks it can complete, and what are the reviews, pros or cons of the tool or company. Below is the format of how you should output your information. You should use google shopping on google search (SERPAPI) tool to obtain the most relevant and accurate information.\n¬†\nName of company/tool\nPrice: Provide if it is a one time purchase, monthly subscription and if there is a free version.\nLimits: Provide any limitations on completing the desired tasks. Is there a limit on the number¬†of tasks that can be completed? Does it only work with certain software?\nSummary of reviews: You should provide an overall summary of the reviews, how many reviews, as well as the star rating of each item. Go in depth on the summary of the reviews. Provide 3-4 pros and 2-3 cons of each item. \nConclusion:\n\n\n\n#additional information \n\n\nBelow is an example of how you should provide responses.\n\nConstant Contact\nPrice\n-Subscription-based only‚Äîno one‚Äëtime purchase or permanent free plan.\n-14‚Äëday free trial available.\n-Plans begin at $12/month (Lite), then $35/month (Standard), and $80/month (Premium). \n\nLimits\n-Automation capabilities are basic: welcome emails, anniversary or birthday triggers, abandoned cart reminders (via Shopify/WooCommerce), and simple single‚Äëtrigger workflows.\n-Deeper automation (multi-step, advanced triggers, conditional logic) requires the Premium plan and is still less flexible than many competitors.\n-Templates and design editors offer limited customization‚Äîimage swapping and background choices are constrained.\n-Supports up to unlimited lists but segmentation is limited unless on higher tiers and granular ‚Äúif‚Äìthen‚Äù logic is absent at lower levels.\n-Autoresponder only sends from your ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù address and does not capture replies within the platform.\n-Sends may have limits and overage fees; no unlimited sends plan. \n\nSummary of Reviews\n\n-Email Tool Tester (1.3 years ago)\n--Star rating not numeric; overall negative on automation.\n--Pros: Good deliverability; useful AI content drafting; supports basic automated campaigns like abandoned carts.\n--Cons: Poor price‚Äëperformance; limited automation; segmentation only on higher plans; challenging cancellation.\n\n-Moosend / MailerLite blog (~recent)\n--Pros: High deliverability (~92%); intuitive interface; multi‚Äëchannel features; extensive integrations (5,500‚Äì7,800 apps); good analytics.\n--Cons: Expensive at scale; automations limited; dated template designs; segmentation and testing capabilities minimal \nMailerLite.\n\n-G2 (various recent reviews)\n--High-end rating: average 4‚Äì5/5 on ease‚Äëof‚Äëuse; automation rated well for simplicity but weaker on customization.\n--Review sample:\n--DeAnn B (5/5): praise for automation ease and organized segmented campaigns; minor template image issues.\n--Jerome T (3.5/5): automation user‚Äëfriendly, but less powerful than ActiveCampaign/Klaviyo.\n--Pros: Ease of use; time‚Äësaving; good for weekly campaign sending; content creation tools; segmentation.\n--Cons: Missing advanced features; limited template customization; sequence edits require rebuild; editing glitches. \n\n-Business.com and Capterra (3‚Äì9 months ago)\n--Business.com rating 9.4/10: highlights autocomplete, autoresponders, deliverability, and editor; cons include no free plan, limited A/B testing, and no unlimited sends. \n--Capterra (Oct¬†2024): 5/5 overall; pro: ease‚Äëof‚Äëuse, automation features; con: pricing high for small lists.\n\n-Reddit feedback\n--Mixed community opinions:\n--‚ÄúConstant Contact is simply a bad product‚Ä¶ way better deliverability, and amazing analytics [elsewhere]‚Äù. \n--‚ÄúTakes FOREVER‚Ä¶ crashes nonstop‚Ä¶ HOGS my CPU‚Äù.\n--Also reports of ‚Äúdifficult cancellation‚Äù and aggressive upselling.\n\nOverall Rating\nBased on ~hundreds of reviews across platforms:\nAverage score: ~4/5‚Äîstrong in usability and basic automation but weak in depth, customization, and price value.\n\nPros (3‚Äì4)\n-Easy to use and set up, especially for beginners. G2 notes intuitive campaign templates, drag-and-drop email creation. \n-Reliable deliverability (~92‚Äì97%) with built-in authentication tools \n-Time-saving email automation, including welcome sequences, anniversaries, abandoned carts, and non-opener resends. \n-Extensive integrations (5K‚Äì7K+ apps), including CRM, e‚Äëcommerce, social channels, event ticketing.\n\nCons (2‚Äì3)\n-Automation is basic‚Äîlimited to single triggers, simple workflows; lacks conditional logic and advanced paths. \n-High cost for features‚Äîvalue diminishes rapidly with contacts list growth; extras (SMS, segmentation, A/B testing) only on higher tiers. \n-Design and editing limitations‚Äîtemplate customization is rigid; editor can be glitchy; sequence adjustments may require rebuilding. \n\nConclusion\nConstant Contact is a solid choice for small businesses seeking easy-to-use, reliable email automation and deliverability with good integration options. However, if you need advanced, flexible automation, granular personalization, or modern design freedom‚Äîand want maximum value‚Äîit may fall short. Based on user feedback, it's best suited for basic autoresponder needs, not complex multistep campaigns."
