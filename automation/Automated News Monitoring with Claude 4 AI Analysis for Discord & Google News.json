The system provides weekly automated monitoring cycles with personalized bot communication and comprehensive content analysis.\n## How it works\nThe workflow follows a sophisticated 7-phase automation process:\nScheduled Activation: Triggers weekly monitoring cycles (default: Mondays at 9 AM)\nQuery Management: Retrieves monitoring topics from centralized Google Sheets configuration\nNews Discovery: Executes comprehensive Google News searches using SerpAPI for each configured topic\nContent Extraction: Scrapes full article content from top 3 sources per topic using Firecrawl\nAI Analysis: Processes scraped content using Claude 4 Sonnet for intelligent synthesis and formatting\nDiscord Optimization: Automatically segments content to comply with Discord's 2000-character message limits\nAutomated Delivery: Posts formatted intelligence reports to Discord channel with branded \"Claptrap\" bot personality\n## Requirements\n\nGoogle Sheets account for query management\nSerpAPI account for Google News access\nFirecrawl account for article content extraction\nAnthropic API access for Claude 4 Sonnet\nDiscord bot with proper channel permissions\nScheduled execution capability (cron-based trigger)\n\n## How to set up\n### Step 1: Configure Google Sheets query management\nCreate monitoring sheet: Set up Google Sheets document with \"Query\" sheet\nAdd search topics: Include industry keywords, competitor names, and relevant search terms\nSheet structure: Simple column format with \"Query\" header containing search terms\nAccess permissions: Ensure n8n has read access to the Google Sheets document\n### Step 2: Configure API credentials\nSet up the following credentials in n8n:\nGoogle Sheets OAuth2: For accessing query configuration sheet\nSerpAPI: For Google News search functionality with proper rate limits\nFirecrawl API: For reliable article content extraction across various websites\nAnthropic API: For Claude 4 Sonnet access with sufficient token limits\nDiscord Bot API: With message posting permissions in target channel\n### Step 3: Customize scheduling settings\nCron expression: Default set to \"0 9 * * 1\" (Mondays at 9 AM)\nFrequency options: Adjust for daily, weekly, or custom monitoring cycles\nTimezone considerations: Configure according to team's working hours\nExecution timing: Ensure adequate processing time for multiple topics\n### Step 4: Configure Discord integration\nSet up Discord delivery settings:\nGuild ID: Target Discord server (currently: 919951151888236595)\nChannel ID: Specific monitoring channel (currently: 1334455789284364309)\nBot permissions: Message posting, embed suppression capabilities\nBrand personality: Customize \"Claptrap\" bot messaging style and tone\n### Step 5: Customize content analysis\nConfigure AI analysis parameters:\nAnalysis depth: Currently processes top 3 articles per topic\nContent format: Structured markdown format with consistent styling\nLanguage settings: Currently configured for French output (easily customizable)\nQuality controls: Error handling for inaccessible articles and content\n## How to customize the workflow\n### Query management expansion\nTopic categories: Organize queries by industry, competitor, or strategic focus areas\nKeyword optimization: Refine search terms based on result quality and relevance\nDynamic queries: Implement time-based or event-triggered query modifications\nMulti-language support: Add international keyword variations for global monitoring\n### Advanced content processing\nArticle quantity: Modify from 3 to more articles per topic based on analysis needs\nContent filtering: Add quality scoring and relevance filtering for article selection\nSource preferences: Implement preferred publisher lists or source quality weighting\nContent enrichment: Add sentiment analysis, trend identification, or competitive positioning\n### Discord delivery enhancements\nRich formatting: Implement Discord embeds, reactions, or interactive elements\nMulti-channel distribution: Route different topics to specialized Discord channels\nAlert levels: Add priority-based messaging for urgent industry developments\nArchive functionality: Create searchable message threads or database storage\n### Integration expansions\nSlack compatibility: Replace or supplement Discord with Slack notifications\nEmail reports: Add formatted email distribution for executive summaries\nDatabase storage: Implement persistent storage for historical analysis and trending\nAPI endpoints: Create webhook endpoints for third-party system integration\n### AI analysis customization\nAnalysis templates: Create topic-specific analysis frameworks and formatting\nCompetitive focus: Enhance competitor mention detection and analysis depth\nTrend identification: Implement cross-topic trend analysis and strategic insights\nSummary levels: Create executive summaries alongside detailed technical analysis\n## Advanced monitoring features\n### Intelligent content curation\nThe system provides sophisticated content management:\nRelevance scoring: Automatic ranking of articles by topic relevance and publication authority\nDuplicate detection: Prevents redundant coverage of the same story across different sources\nContent quality assessment: Filters low-quality or promotional content automatically\nSource diversity: Ensures coverage from multiple perspectives and publication types\n### Error handling and reliability\nGraceful degradation: Continues processing even if individual articles fail to scrape\nRetry mechanisms: Automatic retry logic for temporary API failures or network issues\nContent fallbacks: Uses article snippets when full content extraction fails\nNotification continuity: Ensures Discord delivery even with partial content processing\n## Results interpretation\n### Intelligence report structure\nEach monitoring cycle delivers:\nTopic-specific summaries: Individual analysis for each configured search query\nSource attribution: Complete citation with publication date, source, and URL\nStructured formatting: Consistent presentation optimized for quick scanning\nProfessional analysis: AI-generated insights maintaining factual accuracy and business context\n### Performance analytics\nMonitor system effectiveness through:\nProcessing metrics: Track successful article extraction and analysis rates\nContent quality: Assess relevance and usefulness of delivered intelligence\nTeam engagement: Monitor Discord channel activity and report utilization\nSystem reliability: Track execution success rates and error patterns\n## Use cases\n### Competitive intelligence\nMarket monitoring: Track competitor announcements, product launches, and
